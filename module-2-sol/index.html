                    The Sukhoi Su-30MKI is a multirole combat fighter aircraft jointly developed by the Sukhoi Design Bureau and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Indian Air Force (IAF). Based on the Su-30 fighter aircraft, Su-30MKI is equipped with thrust vectoring control and canards.

The development of the Su-30MKI for the IAF began in 1995. Sukhoi and Irkutsk Aircraft Production Association (now known as Irkut Corporation) were initially responsible for the development and production of the aircraft respectively.

Sukhoi built two prototypes of the Su-30MKI between 1995 and 1998. The first prototype, Su-30I-1, made its first flight in July 1997. Production began at the Irkutsk plant in 2000. The first pre-production aircraft completed its maiden flight in November 2000. India signed a MoU with Russia in October 2000, to start the license production of Su-30MKIs at HAL’s plant. </section>

                   Mirage 2000 is a multirole combat fighter from French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation. It has been operational with the French Air Force since 1984, and has been selected by Abu Dhabi, Egypt, Greece, India, Peru, Qatar, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates.

Mirage 2000 fighters in operation with the French Air Force are: Mirage 2000C/B, a single seater and two seater for air defence; Mirage 2000N, a two seater designed for all weather nuclear penetration at low altitude and very high speed; Mirage 2000D, an upgraded version of the Mirage 2000N for automated bombing using conventional and laser guided munitions; and Mirage 2000-5, incorporating advanced avionics, new multiple target air-to-ground and air-to-air firing procedures using the RDY radar, and new sensor and control systems.During the 2001–02 India–Pakistan standoff,  were used to destroy Pakistani bunkers with precision guided bombs. </p>

                    The MiG-29K fighter bomber aircraft is manufactured by RSK MiG and the Irkutsk Aircraft Production Association Joint Stock Company. The MiG-29, 30 and 33 are known by the Nato code name Fulcrum.

The MiG-29K is the carrier-based version. It took off for its maiden flight in October 1977 and entered service in August 1983.

The mission of the MiG-29 is to destroy hostile air targets within radar coverage limits and to destroy ground targets using unguided weapons in visual flight conditions.

The aircraft’s fixed-wing profile with large wing leading-edge root extensions gives good manoeuvrability and control at subsonic speeds, including manoeuvres at high angles of attack. The maximum operational g-loading is 9g.

A two-seater version, MiG-29M2, took its maiden flight in 2001. A super-manoeuvrable variant, MiG-29M OVT, with 3D thrust-vectoring engine nozzles was successfully in 2006. </p>
